Learning materials for Python Learning

There are practical exercises of different level: begginer, medium & advance!

My favourite one is securedPWDPassword.py, because is check securily (without sending the password to a server) how many times the password was leaked! It splits the password (hashed version) in two parts and only the first one is sent to the server!
